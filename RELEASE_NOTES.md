# 🚀 Release Notes

**This file is auto-generated from PR descriptions on each release.**

---

## 📋 How it works

1. When code is pushed to `main`, semantic-release creates a new version
2. This workflow fetches all merged PRs since the last release
3. PR titles and descriptions are compiled into this file

---

## ✍️ For Developers

To ensure good release notes, write meaningful PR descriptions:

```markdown
## What does this PR do?
- Added hourly pricing option for meeting rooms
- Users can select duration in hours
- Minimum booking is 1 hour

*Next release will populate this file with actual PR descriptions.*
